# Customer Segmentation with RFM
###############################################################

###############################################################
# Business Problem
###############################################################
# FLO wants to segment its customers and determine marketing strategies based on these segments.
# Customer behaviors will be defined, and groups will be created based on these behavioral clusters.

###############################################################
# Dataset Story
###############################################################

# The dataset consists of information derived from the past shopping behaviors of customers who made their last purchases in 2020-2021 through OmniChannel (both online and offline shopping).

# master_id: Unique customer number
# order_channel: Which channel was used for the purchase (Android, iOS, Desktop, Mobile, Offline)
# last_order_channel: The channel where the last purchase was made
# first_order_date: The date of the customer's first purchase
# last_order_date: The date of the customer's last purchase
# last_order_date_online: The date of the customer's last online purchase
# last_order_date_offline: The date of the customer's last offline purchase
# order_num_total_ever_online: Total number of purchases made by the customer online
# order_num_total_ever_offline: Total number of purchases made by the customer offline
# customer_value_total_ever_offline: Total amount paid by the customer in offline purchases
# customer_value_total_ever_online: Total amount paid by the customer in online purchases
# interested_in_categories_12: List of categories the customer shopped in the last 12 months

# TASK 1: Data Understanding and Preparation
import pandas as pd

# 1. Read the flo_data_20K.csv dataset.
# 2. In the dataset,
# a. First 10 observations,
# b. Variable names,
# c. Descriptive statistics,
# d. Missing values,
# e. Variable types.
# 3. Create new variables for each customer's total number of purchases and spending, considering OmniChannel purchases.
# 4. Examine variable types. Convert variables representing dates to the date format.
# 5. Explore the distribution of the number of customers, average number of products purchased, and average spending in different purchase channels.
# 6. Rank the top 10 customers with the highest revenue.
# 7. Rank the top 10 customers with the highest number of orders.
# 8. Modularize the data preprocessing process.
